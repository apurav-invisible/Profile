      They asked for a résumé. I left a crime scene. You're here to understand what should've stayed buried.

        <div class="intro">
          <h1>To the world that never knew what to do with me,</h1>
          <p>If you’re reading this, congratulations — I’ve either vanished, evolved, or crashed the system one last time.</p>
          <p>Consider this my will, my confession, my résumé wrapped in red tape and sarcasm.</p>
          <p>They said “Get serious.”<br>So I did.<br>I seriously became dangerously good at what I do.</p>

          <h2 class="tools-title">My Tools of Madness</h2>
          <p>1. Python – my first weapon. Clean, sharp, and unforgiving.</p>
          <p>2. Flask, HTML, CSS – because I like dressing my insanity in beautiful interfaces.</p>
          <p>3. JavaScript – recently invited it to the party. It talks too much, but it’s useful.</p>
          <p>4. UI/UX Design (Figma) – turning chaos into structure, and structure into illusion.</p>
          <p>5. Filmora (Wondershare) – sometimes, the devil edits too.</p>
          <p>THIS IS A BEGINNING</p>

          <h2 class="tools-title">My Obsession: Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>I don't want to use AI.</p>
          <p>I want to understand it.</p>
          <p>Speak its language. Twist its logic. See if the machine can dream of me the way I dream of breaking it.</p>
          <p>I’ve already begun — building AI projects that think, adapt, and maybe even laugh.</p>

          <h2 class="tools-title">And yes… Cyber Security.</h2>
          <p>Not the keyboard-smashing, movie-style junk.</p>
          <p>I study how trust breaks.</p>
          <p>I poke at firewalls not to enter — just to hear them scream.</p>
          <p>Whether it’s real “cyber security” or not?</p>
          <p>Hehe... I’ll let the terrified sysadmins decide.</p>

          <h2 class="tools-title">And in case you're wondering… Why?</h2>
          <p>Why all of this?</p>
          <p class="tools-title">Because I refuse to be ordinary.</p>
          <p>Because the world hands you a mold — and I use it to light the match.</p>
          <p>Because genius, when unpolished, gets called crazy... until it builds something no one can ignore.</p>

          <h3 class="tools-title">So this is my legacy.</h3>
          <p>A student, still in Class 12 CBSE,</p>
          <p>Still learning,</p>
          <p>Still laughing —</p>
          <p>And already five steps ahead.</p>
          <p>If the world wants my story, they’ll have to read between the lines of broken code and burning blueprints.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>The one you tried to label —</p>
          <p>And failed to understand.</p>
